# SMS Spam Message Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based SMS spam message classifier. It predicts whether a given SMS message is **spam** or **ham** (not spam).

## Features
- Preprocessed SMS data for training.
- Uses machine learning techniques to classify messages.
- Implements a Bag-of-Words model with CountVectorizer for feature extraction.
- Trained using a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.).
